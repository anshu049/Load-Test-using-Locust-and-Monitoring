# Introduction
- This deep dive explores how to optimize scalability using Locust for load testing on Amazon EKS. We'll focus on scaling a Node.js app using Kubernetes' HPA and Cluster Autoscaler based on load generated by Locust workers. This guide aims to provide practical insights for ensuring applications can handle increasing user loads efficiently.

# Create VPC and EKS using Terraform module
- Apply terraform command.
- Add policy to worker to worker node and then apply cluster-autoscaler-autodiscover.yaml.
- Add metric server for HPA to get data.
- We need to create HPA for both locust and app after deploying them.
- kubectl autoscale deployment <deploy-name> --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10
